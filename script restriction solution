--- if there is restrictins to start scripts on windows machine

Set-ExecutionPolicy "parameter"

The policy parameter takes the below values:

Restricted – No scripting allowed
Unrestricted – You can run any script, No signing is required.
RemoteSigned – Good for Test and dev environments. Only files from the internet need to be signed. Otherwise, you’ll see .ps1 is not digitally signed error. This is the default policy setting on servers. More secure option compared with unrestricted.
AllSigned  – local or remote script – A trusted publisher should sign it; only digitally signed PowerShell scripts are allowed.

example: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
